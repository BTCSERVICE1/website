## General news




## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### .NET nanoFramework now runs on ESP32-C3
[.NET nanoFramework](https://github.com/nanoframework) has released firmware images for Espressif [ESP32-C3 series](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3).
.NET now runs on RISC-V processors too! This was - maybe - the very 1st time .NET ever runed on a **RISC-V** processor, thus increasing the reach of .NET as the framework that runs on more platforms.

### DotVVM 4.0 and roadmap for DotVVM 5.0

We've published videos from [DotVVM Virtual Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAFYNAYbsE0&list=PLq1wAETqUjIa8ZHtBuNstZRVBlheO82Rg&index=1), an online event celebrating the release of [DotVVM 4.0](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/88/Released-DotVVM-4-0). 

We were talking about new features in DotVVM 4.0 - **composite controls**, **enhancements in C#-to-JavaScript translations**, some **new features in validation framework**, and much more. We also did some cool demos of **hosting DotVVM apps in MAUI** and presented a new generation of **DotVVM Dynamic Data**, a powerful library which auto-generates forms and grids based of your data models.

The topics on this year’s agenda include C#, ASP.NET, Blazor, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, stories about contributing to open-source packages and building microservices, and, as always, F#! On top of that, we’ll discuss algorithm performance and background tasks in .NET. 

We also invited six experts to share pro tips on how to craft the best games. We’ll cover aspects of performance, UI, and developer habits
