#### .NET nanoFramework Virtual Device now available

.NET nanoFramework virtual device now available as a .NET Tool.
Perfect for on-the-go development, running on CI-CD pipelines, automated tests and other usage scenarios that benefit from not requiring a real hardware device.
Seamless integrated with the project's Visual Studio extension! Check out the tool [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nanoclr).

#### [Chem4Word V3.2 Released](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/2022/12/01/new-version-available/)

We released Chem4Word version 3.2 on Dec 1st! 

This major release includes full reaction handling functionality!

We enhanced our in-house editor, ACME, to support drawing of reactions and also assignment of reactant and product roles.

We're now debating what to add next. Support for multiple compound libraries is attractive, although this comes with a lot of baggage. Such as how we might allow users to build their own libraries, or how we'd host them online.

[Microsoft's tepid support for VSTO](https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/07/microsoft_vsto/) is a big concern for the future of the project: our codebase is C#, and the JavaScript add-in model simply isn't powerful or flexible enough.

We'll keep you updated with news about how our investigations go.
